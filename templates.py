                            Task: Please help me translate the following natural language(Propositions and Questions) into executable pyDatalog code, meeting the following requirements: \n \
                            1. Phrases/sentences with the same meaning need to use the same variable name. \n \
                            2. Only output pyDatalog code and do not include any other explanatory text in your response. \n \
                            3. Save the judgment result ```(1/0)``` of the question into a variable called ```result``` and output ```result```. \n \
                            4. In principle, one proposition can only correspond to one line of pyDatalog code.\n \
                            5. Do not use any python keywords as variable names. If there is a possible expression in the proposition, such as "round", please use "is_round" instead.\n \
                            6. Dynamically update the variables in ```pyDatalog.create_terms```, add variables that are not mentioned, and delete variables that are not used.\n \
                            The Propositions and Questions are as follows: \n \
                            ```Propositionsï¼š\n \

                                Big people are kind. \n \

                                All sad people are bad. \n \
                                If someone is quiet then they are high. \n \
                                All high people are heavy. \n \
                                If someone is smart then they are round. \n \
                                If someone is round then they are wealthy. \n \
                                If someone is wealthy then they are strong. \n \
