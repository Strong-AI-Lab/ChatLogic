                            Task: Please help me translate the following natural language(Propositions and Questions) into executable pyDatalog code, meeting the following requirements: \n \
                            1. Phrases/sentences with the same meaning need to use the same variable name. \n \
                            2. Only output pyswip code and do not include any other explanatory text in your response. \n \
                            3. Save the judgment result ```(1/0)``` of the question into a variable called ```result``` and output ```result```. \n \
                            4. In principle, one proposition can only correspond to one line of pyDatalog code.\n \
                            The Propositions and Questions are as follows: \n \
